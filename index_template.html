				<p>In France, the <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000031694974&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006074220&dateTexte=20191027">Code de l'environnement (article L229-25)</a> states that all private organizations (employing 500 persons in mainland or 250 persons overseas) and all public organizations (employing 250 persons or spanning a population of 50,000) must perform their carbon assessment and publish it on <a href="http://www.bilans-ges.ademe.fr/">ADEME's dedicated platform</a>. This mandatory assessment includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (Scope 3 being only recommended) and must be performed at least once every 4 years for private organizations and once every 3 years for public ones. The report must be submitted along with an action plan to reduce the assessed emissions.</p>
