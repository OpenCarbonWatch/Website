## Our approach

### How did we get here?

The concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already higher than ever during the history
of mankind (see [CO2.earth](https://www.co2.earth/) for the live concentration of carbon dioxyde,
or [CO2 levels](https://www.co2levels.org/) for historical charts covering the previous 800,000
years). There concentrations are increasing each year faster, since anthropic emissions are higher each year
(see [Global Carbon Atlas](http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions) for a map of yearly
emissions per country).

These concentrations have already caused an increase of 0.9°C of the average global temperature with respect
to pre-industrial levels (see NASA's [Vital Signs of the Planet](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/) 
for a graph of the temperature anomaly over time). Even heroic changes
will not avoid an increase of at least 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century, which will already
have huge impacts on Nature and humans (see [Chapter](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-3/)
of IPCC's 2018 report on the impacts of a 1.5°C rise).

In December 2015, 196 state parties adopted the
[Paris agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement),
whose stated goal is to maintain the temperature rise *well below 2°C* and try to *limit it to 1.5°C*.
Unlike the previous agreement, the [Kyoto Protocol](https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol), the Paris
agreement neither sets emission reduction targets or emissions caps for each country, nor defines
enforcement mechanisms. Instead, each country has been invited to defined its own *nationally determined
contribution*. Currently, not only are the pledges and targets set by each country incompatible with
limiting the temperature rise to 2°C, but the enforced and planned policies are insufficient to meet them
(see [Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/) for a per-country analysis).

## What do we do and why?

Reducing the emissions to net zero by the middle of the century (which is required to meet the Paris
agreement) requires a careful tracking of the yearly emissions at all levels (individuals, small or medium
companies, cities, large corporates, countries).

Some countries around the world have adopted mandatory greenhouse gases emissions reporting regulations.
Such regulations enforce the realization and sometimes the publication of reports concerning the yearly
emissions of some organizations, e.g. companies exceeding a threshold of employees, revenue or emissions,
or all large facilities, or all companies of a given business sector. In parallel, many companies around
the world take engagements concerning the reduction of their emissions; either because they feel concerned
by the problem, or because they understand that the subject is important for their customers.

We monitor these legal obligations, self-engagements and the published emission reports. We collect
information from open data sources to bring together the pieces of the puzzle. We believe that such an
initiative can have the following benefits.

* Measuring (or estimating) one's emissions is a key necessary first step towards reducing them. Any
initiative encouraging organizations to undertake carbon reporting will help them understand their
situation and take the most relevant actions first.
* Gathering all emissions related information in a single website will encourage consistency through
transparency: organizations making pledges or communicating on their engagement "for the planet" will
have to face their emission reports year after year.
* Last but not least, in our collective tough journey towards limiting greenhouse gases emissions,
praising organizations making outstanding efforts in this direction can only help.
                
## How can you help?

We deeply believe that there is no single answer to this question. Since the task before us is huge, we will
obviously need all kinds of efforts: small scale or large scale, individual or collective, concerning all
topics. If you believe in carbon reporting, here are a few things we think can help.

* **As a consumer, spend your money wisely.** Look up your favorite companies and brands in our
database to find out whether they are serious about carbon reporting and emission reductions or not.
Challenge them on social networks. Debunk their green-washing statements. On the contrary, praise brands
achieving outstanding results in this direction.
* **As a citizen, ask your representatives to vote for stronger regulations.** Recall them what is at
stake. To be efficient, a regulation should require yearly reporting, concern a well
defined list of entities, define the scopes to be taken into account, and all the reporting data
(including reduction targets) should be made publicly available. An enforcement mechanism should also be
in place. Don't settle for less and watch out for setbacks.
* **As an employee, ask your employer to report its emissions and commit to reductions.**
If you work for a medium-sized company or public
organization, chances are that they are not yet performing a yearly emission report. If carbon reporting
is not mandatory in your country or for your organization, try to insist on the benefits of a voluntary
reporting. If your employer is already performing
assessments on a regular basis (which is often the case for large companies), try to convince them
to pledge strong reduction statements.
* **As an organization leader, take strong actions.** Perform frequent and full-scope reporting.
Commit to absolute value engagements: even if the per product or per money emissions of your company
decay, the atmosphere doesn't care if in the meantime your business doubled. Aim for significant
reductions (a decay rate of 5% per year is needed if everybody starts right now).
* **As an engineer or a scientist, read and audit some detailed reports.** Choose a company or an organization that 
suits you and dig into their carbon reports. Challenge their hypotheses, their methods. Ask them questions about how
they took into account sources of emissions you can think of but don't find in their report. Inform-us of your findings,
as we might wish to develop a carbon reporting review section.
* **As a lawyer or legal expert, help us in our efforts.** We are always looking for legal means of urging public or private organisations to comply with their obligations, and to force the state services responsible for monitoring the application of the law and inflicting sanctions to do so in practice.
* **As a developer or a data-scientist, help us with this website.** We have a large backlog of both data pre-processing
tasks to build a reliable worldwide database of carbon reports and software engineering tasks to build a better website.
Please get in touch so we can find a task that suits you well.

## How to correct mistakes in the data?

Most of the data present on this website comes directly from open data sources, which we do not maintain.
Correcting mistakes directly in the source data sets is probably the best option. We download fresh versions
of the sources we use on a monthly basis, so your changes should be reflected shortly. When correcting the
source data is not possible, we can inject some corrections through our pre-processing workflows. Please
get in touch if you notice something wrong about your organization or on a subject you are familiar with.
