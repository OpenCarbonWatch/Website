## How to correct mistakes in the data?

Most of the data present on this website comes directly from open data sources, which we do not maintain.
Correcting mistakes directly in the source data sets is probably the best option. We download fresh versions
of the sources we use on a monthly basis, so your changes should be reflected shortly. When correcting the
source data is not possible, we can inject some corrections through our pre-processing workflows. Please
get in touch if you notice something wrong about your organization or on a subject you are familiar with.
