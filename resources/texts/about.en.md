## How to correct errors?

Most of the data on this site comes from open sources that we do not administer. Correcting errors directly in the 
source datasets is probably the best option. We regularly download new versions of the sources we use, so changes will 
be taken into account quickly. When it is not possible to correct the source data, we can inject some corrections 
through our pre-processing feeds. Contact us if you notice an error concerning your organization or on a subject that 
is familiar to you.
