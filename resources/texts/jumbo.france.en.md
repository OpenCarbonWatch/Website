In France, since the [Grenelle II law](https://www.senat.fr/dossier-legislatif/pjl08-155.html) (2010), 
the [Environmental Code (article L229-25)](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000031694974&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006074220) 
states that all private organizations (employing 500 persons in mainland or 250 persons overseas) and all public 
organizations (employing 250 persons or spanning a population of 50,000) must perform their carbon assessment and 
publish it on [ADEME's dedicated platform](http://www.bilans-ges.ademe.fr/). 
This mandatory assessment includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (Scope 3 being
only recommended) and must be performed at least once every 4 years for private organizations and once every
3 years for public ones. The report must be submitted along with an action plan to reduce the assessed
emissions.
