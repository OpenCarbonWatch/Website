## How can you help?

We deeply believe that there is no single answer to this question. Since the task before us is huge, we will
obviously need all kinds of efforts: small scale or large scale, individual or collective, concerning all
topics. If you believe in carbon reporting, here are a few things we think can help.

* **As a consumer, spend your money wisely.** Look up your favorite companies and brands in our
database to find out whether they are serious about carbon reporting and emission reductions or not.
Challenge them on social networks. Debunk their green-washing statements. On the contrary, praise brands
achieving outstanding results in this direction.
* **As a citizen, ask your representatives to vote for stronger regulations.** Recall them what is at
stake. To be efficient, a regulation should require yearly reporting, concern a well
defined list of entities, define the scopes to be taken into account, and all the reporting data
(including reduction targets) should be made publicly available. An enforcement mechanism should also be
in place. Don't settle for less and watch out for setbacks.
* **As an employee, ask your employer to report its emissions and commit to reductions.**
If you work for a medium-sized company or public
organization, chances are that they are not yet performing a yearly emission report. If carbon reporting
is not mandatory in your country or for your organization, try to insist on the benefits of a voluntary
reporting. If your employer is already performing
assessments on a regular basis (which is often the case for large companies), try to convince them
to pledge strong reduction statements.
* **As an organization leader, take strong actions.** Perform frequent and full-scope reporting.
Commit to absolute value engagements: even if the per product or per money emissions of your company
decay, the atmosphere doesn't care if in the meantime your business doubled. Aim for significant
reductions (a decay rate of 5% per year is needed if everybody starts right now).
* **As an engineer or a scientist, read and audit some detailed reports.** Choose a company or an organization that 
suits you and dig into their carbon reports. Challenge their hypotheses, their methods. Ask them questions about how
they took into account sources of emissions you can think of but don't find in their report. Inform-us of your findings,
as we might wish to develop a carbon reporting review section.
* **As a lawyer or legal expert, help us in our efforts.** We are always looking for legal means of urging public or private organisations to comply with their obligations, and to force the state services responsible for monitoring the application of the law and inflicting sanctions to do so in practice.
* **As a developer or a data-scientist, help us with this website.** We have a large backlog of both data pre-processing
tasks to build a reliable worldwide database of carbon reports and software engineering tasks to build a better website.
Please get in touch so we can find a task that suits you well.
