## Who are we?

We are a small collective whose main objective is to encourage public and private organizations to measure their 
greenhouse gases emissions, so that they are aware of their own impact on climate change and can take the necessary 
decisions to reduce it significantly, then verify the effects of these decisions and thus ensure that they follow a 
reduction path compatible with the international stakes.

To do this, we consolidate open data and format it to facilitate its communication to the public. 
Our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/OpenCarbonWatch) contain the full details on our processes for handling 
this data and we will be happy to answer your questions.
