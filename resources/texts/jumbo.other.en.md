### Other countries

Other countries or groups of countries around the world have adopted mandatory carbon reporting regulations,
such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, New Zealand,
South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, etc.

We definitely plan on displaying open data for these countries in the following months or years.
If you are interested in one of these carbon regulations, or if you know about another one, please get in
touch. We look forward to integrating data coming from other regions of the world.
