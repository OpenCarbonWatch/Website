# Context

Since the industrial revolution, human activities and societies have been structured by the use of fossil fuels, 
with a strong impact on the climate. Preserving an inhabitable planet in the 21st century now represents an immense 
challenge.

### A historical concentration

The concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already higher than ever during the history
of *homo sapiens* (see  [Vital Signs of the Planet](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/) 
for the live concentration of carbon dioxyde and historical charts covering the previous 800,000
years). These concentrations continue to increase each year in response to significant annual anthropogenic emissions
(see [Global Carbon Atlas](http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions) for a map of yearly
emissions per country).

### An already significant temperature rise

These concentrations have already caused an increase of 1°C of the average global temperature with respect
to pre-industrial levels (see NASA's [Vital Signs of the Planet](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/) 
for a graph of the temperature anomaly over time). Even heroic changes in our societies
will not avoid an increase of at least 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century, which will already
have huge impacts on Nature and humans (see [Chapter 3](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-3/)
of IPCC's 2018 report on the impacts of a 1.5°C rise).

### A very limited carbon budget

According to IPCC's 2018 report, the remaining carbon budget starting January 1st, 2020, 
is of 240 GtCO2 in order to have a 66% chance of limiting the temperature rise to 1,5°C, 
or of 990 GtCO2 in order to have a 66% chance of limiting the temperature rise to 2°C
(see [Table 2.2 of Chapter 2](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-2/)).

Humanity has already consumed most of its total carbon budget (see Mercator Research Institute's 
[Carbon Clock](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/research/co2-budget.html) 
for the corresponding remaining time based on current annual emissions, 
or Open Climate Data's [Climate Spirals](https://openclimatedata.net/climate-spirals/from-emissions-to-global-warming-line-chart/)
for nice visual representations).

The planned fossil fuels productions up to 2030 already exceed the 1,5°C budget 
(see the [Production Gap](http://productiongap.org/2019report/) report). 
For more on the notion of carbon budget, see Global Carbon Project's [Carbon Budget Report](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/index.htm).

### An insufficient worldwide agreement

In December 2015, 196 state parties adopted the
[Paris agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement),
whose stated goal is to maintain the temperature rise *well below 2°C* and try to *limit it to 1.5°C*.
Unlike the previous agreement, the [Kyoto Protocol](https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol), the Paris
agreement neither sets emission reduction targets or emissions caps for each country, nor defines
enforcement mechanisms. Instead, each country has been invited to define its own *nationally determined
contribution* and re-evaluate it periodically.

Currently, not only is the sum of the pledges made by countries incompatible with
limiting the temperature rise to 2°C, but the enforced and planned policies in each country are insufficient to meet 
the national targets (see [Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/) for a per-country analysis).
