## What do we do and why?

Reducing the emissions to net zero by the middle of the century (which is required to meet the Paris
agreement) requires a careful tracking of the yearly emissions at all levels (individuals, small or medium
companies, cities, large corporates, countries).

Some countries around the world have adopted mandatory greenhouse gases emissions reporting regulations.
Such regulations enforce the realization and sometimes the publication of reports concerning the yearly
emissions of some organizations, e.g. companies exceeding a threshold of employees, revenue or emissions,
or all large facilities, or all companies of a given business sector. In parallel, many companies around
the world take engagements concerning the reduction of their emissions; either because they feel concerned
by the problem, or because they understand that the subject is important for their customers.

We monitor these legal obligations, self-engagements and the published emission reports. We collect
information from open data sources to bring together the pieces of the puzzle. We believe that such an
initiative can have the following benefits.

* Measuring (or estimating) its emissions is a key first step in reducing them. Any initiative that encourages organizations to measure and report their carbon footprint will help them understand their situation and take the most relevant actions first.
* Gathering all emissions information on a single website will promote consistency through transparency: it will be possible to compare the commitments made "for the planet" by organizations with the reality of their performance.
* Finally, it will be possible to highlight organizations that are making significant efforts to reduce their carbon footprint.
